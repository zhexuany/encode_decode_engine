File:
alloc.h & alloc.c
the implementation about new memory allocator. With these files, we do not need check the return value of malloc when we call it every time.

codec.c & codec.h
the implementation about helper functions, encodeDir and decodeDir function.

codec_4061.c
driver function. Extract the flag operation from argument vector. And then use switch statement to call different function for either decoding or encoding directory.

makeargv.h
cited from textbook

Purpose:
this program will recursively travel a given directory and either
decode or encode file according to the flag option specified before
running. In the process of running this program, it will write
summary of each file into a report file. At then end of this program,
we fork two child process and call system call sort and rm.  sort is
for sorting contents inside temporarily report file. After we sort
the temporarily file, rm will be used to delete the temporarily
report file.


How to compile the program:
  Please make sure you have downloaded all the .c files, makefile and .h files, before you start to grade this assignment.
  In addition, all files must be in the same directory. Then type “make” on the shell and makefile will compile the program automatically.
  Our makefile will automatically compile all .c and .h file even
  they are belong to us. So, please make sure there are no extra .c
  or .h files.


-Use the program from the shell
	(syntax): ./codec_4061 <flag option> some-directory outputfile
